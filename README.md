# knowledgeSharing

`knowledgeSharing` is an R package for analyzing knowledge sharing and convergence in conversations.  
It uses Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to build a shared semantic space, then applies a sliding-window approach to compute group-level centroids and measure how the conversationâ€™s semantic content evolves over time.

--- 

## ðŸ“š Background

The approach implemented in this package is inspired by the work of Andy Dong in the foundational paper:

Dong, A. (2005). The latent semantic approach to studying design team communication. Design Studies, 26(5), 445â€“461.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2004.12.003

Dong introduced the concept of a semantic centroid for a team, and measured how individual contributions converge toward or diverge from this centroid over time. This method has since been adapted for broader use in communication analysis.

## Features

- Build a **global LSA semantic space** across an entire conversation.
- Compute **sliding-window centroids** for groups or overall.
- Quantify **knowledge change dynamics** using:
  - Cosine similarity between windows
  - Euclidean distance between centroids
- Generate **visualizations** to explore how knowledge sharing and convergence unfold during interactions.
- Works with **grouped or ungrouped** data.

## Installation

You can install the development version directly from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Hollandcm1/knowledgeSharing")
```

### Example Output Figures

#### 1. Cosine Similarity Plot (`cosine_plot.png`)  
This figure shows how similar each sliding-window centroid is to the one before it, using **cosine similarity**. Higher values (closer to 1) indicate that consecutive windows contain highly overlapping semantic content, while lower values reflect shifts in the conversation toward new ideas or topics.

#### 2. Euclidean Distance Plot (`euclid_plot.png`)  
This figure tracks the **magnitude of change** in the centroid between consecutive windows, measured as Euclidean distance in the semantic space. Larger distances mean that the groupâ€™s conversation vector has shifted substantially, while smaller distances suggest incremental change or stability.

#### 3. Combined Plot (`combined_plot.png`)  
This combines cosine similarity and Euclidean distance into one panel, allowing for a direct comparison of the two measures. Together, they show not only whether the conversation is moving in new directions, but also how big or small those changes are.

#### 4. Cosine Colored by Euclidean Distance (`cosine_colored_by_euclid_plot.png`)  
This hybrid visualization overlays Euclidean distance as a **color gradient** on the cosine similarity plot. It highlights not only when the semantic similarity dips, but also how strongly the group is diverging in its shared knowledge space at that moment.
